This is Broadcast Buddy, version 1.1.  Broadcast Buddy is free software,
released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

Broadcast Buddy is a small Qt application that allows you to display full-screen
slides on multiple computers from a single controlling computer.

To compile Broadcast Buddy:
- Extract the source files into a directory, and cd to it
- Run qmake
- Run make (or the make program your compiler uses)
- If running make causes an error, run "make distclean", "qmake", and "make" 

Broadcast Buddy uses a single executable (BroadcastBuddy) for all functionality.
When you start the program, you're presented with an editor for slides.  You can
add and remove slides to the list using the + and - buttons and edit them using
the text boxes on the right side of the window.

Initially, the program will act as a server, listening for incoming connections
from clients running the same program.  If others connect to your server, you
can then broadcast slides to them using the "Broadcast" button, or the options
in the Broadcast menu.  You can disconnect all clients at any time by selecting
the "Disconnect" option in the "Connections" menu.

To connect to another computer as a client, select "Connect to Server" from the
"Connection" menu and enter the server's address.  If a connection is
successfully established, you will see "Connected to Master" in the status bar.
Once connected, any messages broadcast from the master will appear full-screen.
To exit the full-screen view, press the escape key.  To disconnect from the
server, select "Disconnect" from the "Connection" menu.

As of version 1.1, you may broadcast an emergency message at any time without 
entering it in the script editor.  Simply press Ctrl-E or select "Emergency 
Broadcast" from the "Broadcast" menu, and enter your desired text in the dialog 
box.  The text you enter will flash on the screens of every connected client.
